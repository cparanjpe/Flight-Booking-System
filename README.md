# Flight-Booking-System
Flight booking system built using Java and Java FX(for GUI).
You'll need to download jar files for connecting to database and using mail server.
I'have used "mysql-connector-j-8.0.31.jar" & "javax.mail-1.6.2-javadoc.jar"
Functionalities:
👉Login & Register pages
👉🏼Dashboard with options for Domestic and International Flights
👉🏼Flight booking interface and Internet Banking Payment options as well as native app wallet payment facility
👉🏼Ticket cancellation
👉🏼Email conformations for booking & cancellations .OTP for forgot password(via email).
